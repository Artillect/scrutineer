# Scrutineer (Proposed name)

Scrutineer is what I like to consider the future spiritual successor to Highland Scrutineer, a project abandoned in 2007. It was used to tally results for Scottish Highland Dancing competitions. The current version is unsuitable for use, but future versions should be usable. Currently it is text-based, with console input. This is mostly for testing purposes. I plan to have a GUI-based version out by the next dance competition season, or at least before the end of the year. After that I will begin deployment.

Why use Scrutineer and not Highland Scrutineer?

Scrutineer will be supported by me and will be much cheaper, and will get regular updates according to SOBHD rules updates. It will also be modernized to be able to run on newer operating systems easily, and should be able to be run on old computers.
